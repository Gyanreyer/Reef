# Reef

This project is an underwater simulation of a shark chasing fish made using the Unity 3D engine with scripts written in C#.
All art assets were personally made by me using Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop.

This was my final project for my Interactive Media Development course, I received a grade of 96% on this assignment.

You may check out the assets and scripts used in the project folder "Geyer_FinalWorld" or open the project up in Unity if you have it installed.
You may also run the program in Windows with the executable file in the "Executable Version" folder.
